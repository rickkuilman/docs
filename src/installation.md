# Installation

[[toc]]

## Requirements

- PHP ^8.0
- Laravel 8+
- MySQL 5.7+ / PostgreSQL 9.2+
- exif PHP extension (on most systems it will be installed by default)
- GD PHP extension (used for image manipulation)

## Install GetCandy

### Composer require package

```sh
composer require getcandy/getcandy
```

## Install a search provider

GetCandy uses Laravel scout for search. We have had good success with using Meilisearch. Although it's entirely up to you as long as it's compatible.

## Going with Meilisearch

If you're on OSX then you could make use of [Takeout](https://github.com/tighten/takeout) which makes getting Meilisearch set up on Docker a breeze.

Meilisearch also provide great documentation on how to get set up.

[Install Meilisearch](https://docs.meilisearch.com/learn/getting_started/installation.html)

Once you've done that, simple require the composer packages.

```sh
composer require meilisearch/meilisearch-php
```

### Hub Authentication

We use our own authentication guard for the hub, nothing crazy, it just piggy backs off Laravel's own but allows us to use the `staff` table instead of users.
Just add this to your `auth.php` config file:

```php
'guards' => [
    // ...
    'staff' => [
        'driver' => 'getcandyhub',
    ],
]
```

### Run migrations

As you'd expect, there's quite a few tables GetCandy needs to function, so run any migrations

```sh
php artisan migrate
```

### Run the Artisan installer

```sh
php artisan getcandy:install
```

This will take you through a set of questions to configure your GetCandy install. The process includes...

- Creating a default admin user (if required)
- Specifying the table prefix
- Seeding initial data
- Publishing config files
- Optionally, installing demo data
- Inviting you to star our repo on GitHub ðŸ˜Ž

Note: there isn't currently a function to automatically remove the demo data.


::: tip Success ðŸŽ‰
You are now installed!

### Running Seeders

```sh
php artisan db:seed --class=GetCandy\\\\Database\\\\Seeders\\\\DemoSeeder
```
